# plasticity-blender-addon

Experimental Plasticity blender addon to send facet data over websockets

Various QOL improvements to the Plasticity Bridge Blender add-on:

- Consolidated Mark Sharp and Mark Sharp at boundaries into a single operator (AutoMarkEdgesOperator) with options to mark selection as Hard Edges or UV Seams (Mark Sharp, Mark Seam).⁠
- Added functionality: Smart Edges Marking - Only works on entire mesh selection and not individually selected polygons that are part of a Plasticity group. Will mark edges as Sharp or UV seam using the logic of MarkSharpEdgesForPlasticityGroupsWithSplitNormalsOperator.
- Added functionality to arbitrarily select polygons that are part of Plasticity surface groups and mark their boundaries instead of marking boundaries of individual Plasticity surfaces (for mark as Sharp and with added UV seams functionality).⁠
- Added functionality to merge existing UV seams based on arbitrary Plasticity group polygon selection.
- Added functionality to select Plasticity groups edges.⁠
- Exposed prop_surface_angle_tolerance parameter, allowing users to have more control when re-meshing and wanting to keep small objects having smooth curves. Works well in combination when using small values for Min Width.
- SimilarGeometrySelector: select all objects in a scene that have similar geometry.
- SelectedJoiner: join selected objects.
- SelectedUnjoiner: UnJoin selected objects (original names won't be restored).
- NonOverlappingMeshesMerger: merge all the non-overlapping objects in a scene.  
- OpenUVEditorOperator:  open selected objects in the UV editor.
- Refacet Options Presets - create/save/load presets for the Refacet options.
